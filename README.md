# DNA-Sequence-Generator
This is basically meant to be a sequence generator for if you want a large amount of sequences based upon a singel imput

KEY:
{"M": ["A", "C"], "R": ["A", "G"],"W": ["A", "T"], "S": ["C", "G"], "Y": ["C", "T"], "K": ["G", "T"], "V": ["A", "C", "G"], "H": ["A", "C", "T"], "B": ["C", "G", "T"], "D" : ["A", "G", "T"], "N": ["A", "T", "C", "G"]}

These are all substitutes for a combo of ATCG, this means that if I imput YY, it will spit out four things:

CC TT
CT TC

This will alow you to generate large masses of sequences based upon your input

Also the data is stored in chunks, as to not destroy your computer. yw :D
